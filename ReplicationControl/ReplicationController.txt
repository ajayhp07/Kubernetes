ReplicationController
=======================
This is a high level Kubernets object that can be used for handling 
multiple replicas of a Pod.Here we can perfrom Load Balancing
and Scalling

ReplicationController uses keys like "replicas,template" etc in the "spec" section
In the template section we can give metadata related to the pod and also use
another spec section where we can give containers information

Create a replication controller for creating 3 replicas of httpd
vim repilication-controller.yml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
 name: httpd-rc
 labels:
  author: ajay
spec:
 replicas: 3
 template:
  metadata:
   name: httpd-pod
   labels:
    author: ajay
  spec:
   containers:
    - name: myhttpd
      image: httpd
      ports:
       - containerPort: 80
         hostPort: 8080
...

To create the httpd replicas from the above file
kubectl create -f replication-controller.yml

To check if 3 pods are running an on whcih slaves they are running
kubectl get pods -o wide

To delete the replicas
kubectl delete -f replication-controller.yml
